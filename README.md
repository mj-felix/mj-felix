## Who am I?

I am originally from Poland but have been living in NZ for the last 8 years. My original name is Maciej SzczÄ™sny. As no one can pronounce it, I shorten my first name to first and last letter - MJ and use direct translation of my surname to English - Felix. MJ Felix. Short and sweet!

<!--I used to be a Technical Business Analyst but then decided to shift my career to software engineering.
